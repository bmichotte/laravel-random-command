Aren't you tired of having to think about which artisan command to execute? This package takes that pain away. It provides a `random` command that will pick a random command and execute it.

```bash
php artisan random
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-random-command
```

We don't recommend installing this in your production environment. Or your local environment. In fact it might be best if you don't install this at all.

## Usage

This is how you can unleash the power of the random command. Just execute it and don't look back!

```bash
php artisan random
```
